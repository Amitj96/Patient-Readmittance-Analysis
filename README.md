# Patient-Readmittance-Analysis
The goal of this project is to predict if a patient will require a follow-up appointment in the immediate future.
The dataset is from UCI machine learning repository.

Since it was a classification problem, I began the analysis with simple logistic regression model.
I then improved this model by tuning the regularization and elastic parameters by grid search and cross validation.
I further tried random forest model and followed the same approach.
